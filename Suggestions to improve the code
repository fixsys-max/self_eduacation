Here are some suggestions to improve the code:

1. Use more descriptive function and variable names. Names like `task_11` or `cnt` are not very informative and can make the code harder to read and understand.

2. Use type hints consistently throughout the code to improve readability and maintainability.

3. Use f-strings for string formatting throughout the code to make the code cleaner and more readable.

4. Remove unnecessary comments or add more useful ones to help explain what the code is doing.

5. Consider using `join()` instead of string concatenation when building up strings to improve performance.

6. Use a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop in `task_12` to make the code cleaner and easier to read.

7. Simplify `task_31` by using the modulo operator `%` to calculate the remainder of the division.
